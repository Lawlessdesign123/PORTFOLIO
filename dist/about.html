              At Europcar I am responsible for generating new business & retaining clients in the corporate car hire space.

            <p id="design"><strong>Web Development</strong><br>
              Web Development has been something that has really interested me for a number of years, this year I finally made the plunge to learn more about the technologies out there and use them create new things that benefit myself and others. So far I have a good grasp of frontend technologies including - HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, SASS, Vanilla JS and the basics of Angular. I have been using these new skills to put together websites, web apps and useful tools to help clients & colleagues. Some of the projects that I have been working on recently can be found in the Work section, with a link to my code on GitHub. One of the bigger projects that I am currently working on alone is an all in one web rostering app - the idea is to make it easier to create, publish, send & amend rosters for staff.
              Ideally I would be looking to bring these skills into a new account management position & create new tools & apps geared towards improving sales & customer experience.<br> Atom, Bootstrap, SASS, Angular & Github would be some of the tools I use in this area.
